This script tells you what pages two of yourÂ  friends like in common on Facebook.

check out the libs/index.php file. 

I have done this using facebook php sdk . This assignment was new to me and i really 
enjoyed it . I never worked with FB api. I learnt alot of things like:-

1. how to work with FB API.
2. How to deploy your fb app on Heroku. 
3. Integrating FB login in your application.
4. I actually deployed one sample app on Heroku. Check out the link below

It's a sample app. When we are developing FB APP Heroku give us  produnction env 
and we can set our development env for same APP. Heroku is really cool.
