In second assignment as i understand that i have to write a program similar to nslookup utility which we have in linux. 

I never did network programming but this assignment was also cool and gave me good understanding of netwrok programming. 

# In first file StupidLookup.class i tried to make utility like nslookup which give you interactive interface to find 
Ip of various domain servers and vice versa.If you type localhost it will give you IP of localhsot and vice versa.

# In second file Port_scan.class i tried to do port scaning which tells you which port are using by your local machine. 
 



what i learned :-

1. what is socket and socket programming and how we can use java socket packages for information security.
